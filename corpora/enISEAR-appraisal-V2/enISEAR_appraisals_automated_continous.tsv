I was waiting desperately for my computer to arrive which was the Sinclair ZX80 that my dad had ordered from Sinclair Research, I was absolutely addicted to computers as an autistic child but only had access to one for a limited time when my dad occasionally brought a Commodore Pet home from work and I was absolutely desperate to get a computer of my own. Every day I'd come back from school desperately hoping it had arrived to another day of disappointment. When it finally arrived after lots of delays I felt a huge amount of intense ... and also excitement, it was one of the best warm feelings as an autistic child I could have felt, it was like all my Christmas's had come together in one, I couldn't wait to get it connected and only my parents forcing me to go to bed later that night forced me away from it or I would have stayed up all night and the ... of receiving it remained for a long time, this remained an obsession that never ended. It's probably difficult to understand how much ... I felt to receive such a basic computer by someone who doesn't have an addictive autistic interest like I did and still have, but I haven't stopped using computers every day since then and I'm now 49 years old.	0.15	0.46	-0.33	1.46	0.09	-0.21

I told all of my friends that we shouldn't be doing this to old ladies, some agreed, some didn't, but I felt ... all the same.	-0.11	-0.21	0.07	-0.73	1.31	-0.07
